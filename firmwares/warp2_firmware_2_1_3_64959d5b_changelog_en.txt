- Add automatic DC fault protector test after each charging session and at least every 24 hours (EVSE 2.0 Bricklet firmware 2.1.13)
- Make sure active CP disconnect can not be turned off again through API from external (EVSE 2.0 Bricklet firmware 2.1.13)
- Make sure meter type is only reconfigured once per complete read of register set (EVSE 2.0 Bricklet firmware 2.1.13)
- Reset local timeout counter when meter is found for the first time (EVSE 2.0 Bricklet firmware 2.1.13)
- Improve charge management efficiency by using line currents if available
- Add button to trigger a test of the DC fault protector
- Add last seen NFC tag to Modbus TCP
